# SuperPowers electron build script

This will produce builds of your SuperPowers game for:

* win32
* win64 
* linux64
* osx64

FROM a mac (probably works in linux too)


## Usage

* This is assuming you have a folder called 'builds' with a folder called 'web' inside it
* Create your build from SuperPowers, pointing the output directory to 'web'
* Run this script from inside the builds folder
